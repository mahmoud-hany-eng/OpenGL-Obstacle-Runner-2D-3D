OpenGL Obstacle Runner (2D & 3D)

A 2D and 3D obstacle avoidance game developed in C++ using OpenGL (GLUT).

This project demonstrates real-time rendering, collision detection, state management, and dynamic difficulty scaling using procedural gameplay logic.

Project Overview

This repository contains two implementations:

2D Version – Top-down obstacle avoidance game

3D Version – Perspective-based runner with depth simulation

Both versions were built from scratch using OpenGL and GLUT without any external game engine.

Core Features
